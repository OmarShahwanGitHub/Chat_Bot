# Python-JSON-Chatbot
The chatbot is designed to become more intelligent in terms of its responses through its gained experiences with users asking it questions. Users are prompted to teach the bot how to respond if their question does not come to a close match to anything previously stored in its knowledge base.
It then documents the questions it is asked and answers it has been taught into a JSON knowledge base file where the memory information is stored for further interactions.
